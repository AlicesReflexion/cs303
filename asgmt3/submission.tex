\section{}
A \texttt{const\_iterator} is useful in preventing modifying the referenced value. It's simply about const correctness, and informs what the programmer should be able to do. \texttt{iterator}, by contrast, has read-write access, and is useful in scenarios where that is necessary.

\section{}
\subsection*{a}
An \texttt{iterator}. Regardless of whether you have an array-based structure, or a linked-list structure, you need to be able to change either the value of the next item, or the pointer to the next item.
\subsection*{b}
\texttt{iterator} as well. You are modifying data, so you cannot be read-only.
\subsection*{c}
For this one, a \texttt{cost\_iterator} will suffice. We are not changing any data.
\subsection*{d}
\texttt{iterator} as well. We can avoid changing the element pointed to if we're using a linked-list structure, but we still need to change the element before it to point to the new item. And of course, in an array-based structure, we're going to be moving elements around in the array to make space for the new element.
